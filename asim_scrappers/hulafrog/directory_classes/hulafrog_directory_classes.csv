Utilizing modest costumes and coreography, and appropriate songs, we teach our students professional quality dance, vocal and acting skills that build their confidence and character.  



You can find our after-school programs offered through CUSD, and Tumbelweed Recreation Center.  New this year, we are alos offering classes during the day focused on home school families.  We have 2 locations for these classes.



One at Bethany Christian School 6304 South Price Road, Tempe, and the other at First Baptist Chandler, 3405 South Arizona Ave, Chandler.  Clases start for this semester the week of 8/27.  



One of the great things about this program is that each semester, we perform 3 times.  Once at the class location, once at a nursing home (this helps the kids give back a little to the community) and once at a public venue, like a mall.  This semester, the performance is entitled ""Happiness Is...""  It is so fun and shares a great message for the kids.  It is about a child's search for happiness and his realization that it can be found all around him.

Many studios offer flashy d?cor, over the top competitive options and very expensive pricing.

At Ocotillo Dance Center, we do things a little differently?

        In 2009, we opened our doors as ?Studios of Ocotillo.? Two years later we have a new name, but the same philosophy. Ocotillo Dance Center was created with the family in mind. It?s a place where students come to learn the ART and the JOY of dance. It gives students a chance to learn in an environment that fosters great technique and passion that you won?t find anywhere else.  Ocotillo Dance Center strives to find new, fun, innovative and exciting ways to bring dance to the Chandler and Phoenix communities. If you?ve been looking for a studio that fosters creativity, passion and something a little different, we hope you?ll take a minute to check out our beautiful spaces in the Downtown Ocotillo Center, and maybe try a class or two! Remember, the first one is always on us.",2,http://hulafrog.com/hulastock/subcat/Default-Image-Camps-Dance.jpg

Utilizing modest costumes and coreography, and appropriate songs, we teach our students professional quality dance, vocal and acting skills that build their confidence and character.  



You can find our after-school programs offered through CUSD, and Tumbelweed Recreation Center.  New this year, we are alos offering classes during the day focused on home school families.  We have 2 locations for these classes.



One at Bethany Christian School 6304 South Price Road, Tempe, and the other at First Baptist Chandler, 3405 South Arizona Ave, Chandler.  Clases start for this semester the week of 8/27.  



One of the great things about this program is that each semester, we perform 3 times.  Once at the class location, once at a nursing home (this helps the kids give back a little to the community) and once at a public venue, like a mall.  This semester, the performance is entitled ""Happiness Is...""  It is so fun and shares a great message for the kids.
